	<h1>How it work</h1>
	<p>The SMS notifications feature in the Smart Attendance System with RFID via SMS Integration is designed to send real-time alerts to relevant parties, such as parents or supervisors, when a student or employee is absent. This feature works by automatically sending an SMS notification to a designated phone number when an individual with an assigned RFID tag fails to check-in at a designated location or if the individual checks-in late or checks-out early.<br><br>The system is integrated with an SMS gateway, which allows the system to send notifications to designated phone numbers. The SMS notifications can be customized to include relevant information, such as the name of the absent individual and the reason for the absence. This feature helps to keep everyone informed and enables quick intervention when necessary.<br><br>The SMS notifications feature is a valuable tool in the Smart Attendance System with RFID via SMS Integration, as it allows organizations to proactively manage attendance and address any issues that may arise. It also provides an additional layer of accountability, ensuring that students or employees are aware of their attendance status and the consequences of non-attendance.</p>
